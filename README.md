# Potential Flow

A simple implmentation of fundamental 2D potential flows

Installation using the following command when working directory is same as `setup.py`

```
pip install .
```

## Modeled Flows

* Uniform flow
* Source/sink
* Doublet
* Vortex

## Analysis

* Calculation of velocities
* Calculation of stream and potential functions
* Superposition of flows
* Calculation of pressure
* Calcualtion of forces
